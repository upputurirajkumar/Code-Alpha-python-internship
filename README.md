# Code-Alpha-python-internship
The following is the list of projects that were implemented during the internship for the code Alpha programming language using Python.
This repository houses the work that I was able to do during the Code Alpha Python internship. These projects show typical examples of basic programming with Python and several different aspects of programming. Below are the descriptions of each project: 

1. Basic Chatbot

The Basic Chatbot project included using a rule-based model, which can address the inputs provided by the user. The chatbot replies based on several keywords/phrases that the user inputs, making the conversation as natural as possible for the user. It also assisted in discovering the proficiency of strings, conditions, and input and output in Python.

Features:

  .Related to greetings and farewells.
  
  .The communication style of the information is preset with specific keywords.
  
  .Handles unknown inputs gracefully.

2. Hangman Game

The title of the project is called Hangman Game, this is a word-guessing game, whereby the player has to guess each character in the word before being limited to the number of chances given. It was demanded to use loops, conditional statements, sets, and strings, and make an interactive game in this project.

Features:

  .Chooses a word randomly fro a list of words that has been prepared in advanced.
  
  .Shows the current state of the word with underscores for the letters of the word not yet guessed by the player.
  
  .Keeps the score of the letters guessed by the player.
  
  .Refreshes the number of remaining lives and gives the result of guessed letters.
  
  .This puts an end to the game showing that the player has won or that the player has lost.

3. Stock Portfolio Tracker
   
The Stock Portfolio Tracker project is a console-based application involving a user interface for which the user can add stocks, remove stocks, and obtain a total value of the portfolio. This project proved useful in the learning process as it assisted with grasping the concept of object-oriented programming, data structures, and simple financial calculations.

Features:

  .Enables the user to enter the different stocks available in the market together with their corresponding designations and the number of shares.
  
  .Allows the removal of stocks by the user from the portfolio.
  
  .This function computes the sum of the total value of the portfolio of the account.

Conclusion

    The above projects were of great help in learning Python programming skills and improved problem-solving and coding ability. 
    It comprise of basic programs such as input and output, decides branching and looping structures, data structures, and introduction to object-oriented programming with Python.
